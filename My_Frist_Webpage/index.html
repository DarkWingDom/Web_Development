            is a member of the Woodpecker family. This pidgeon size family
            member can be identified by the red triangle on the back of it's
            neck. They appear to have an overall brown color with a white
            bottom. With a close look the brownish appearance is actually a rich
            pattern of black spots, bars and crescents. The undersides of the
            tail and wing feathers are bright yellow.

          as they have been known to damage houses and other buildings. The male
          Flicker lacks the ability to attract a mate through song so they
          resort to "pecking" on surfaces to announce their presence. See video
          below of the bird at work (No Sound).

          Native to most of North America, parts of Central America, Cuba and the Cayman Islands.
          They do generally nest in holes in trees as other Woodpeckers.
          However, it has been found that they will also burrow in the ground.
          The <em>Northern Flicker</em> spends a lot of time on the ground and
          when found in trees they are usually stood upright.
